<content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/engassets/Espresso-OG-image.ff47695fd8.png&quot; class=&quot;ff-og-image-inserted&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot; css-1ebjj9g e18qdnq10&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries are making further moves to take warfare into orbit. So finds the Secure World Foundation, an American think-tank, in a report published today. The report catalogues kit such as America’s Aegis and Russia’s upcoming S-500 air-defence systems, which can blow up satellites. Russia has also deployed “sub-satellites”, which could be fired from satellites as projectiles. China is upgrading its own anti-satellite missiles, some of which could be fired from lorries. Despite remarks from French officials about equipping satellites with defensive machine-guns, no such plan has been made public. But France, like India, has begun work on lasers to “dazzle” satellite sensors. America, China and Russia have tested similar equipment. Those three countries can jam satellite signals, something Iran is working on too. Russia is even designing jammers for use in orbit. Future conflicts could be fought among the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
